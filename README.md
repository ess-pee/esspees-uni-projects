# Shaurya's University Projects

#### This repository contains most projects I had developed while in University, all of these projects were designed, written and operated by me. Notably it is missing code from a burglar alarm system furnished with facial recognition, an e-commerce website, and the automatic anaesthesia delivery controller. The code for all of the three is lost at the moment.

#### I have experience programming in the following languages as reflected in the projects:  
- Python
- Matlab
- C++

#### All of these projects should be usable, apart from perhaps the surgical robot code which was hard coded for our specific pin configuration. As evident it contains many machine learning projects highlighting proficiency with techniques such as data augmentation, principal component analysis, regression and classfiication used in various contexts like machine health diagnosis, plant management, environment health prediction, etc. 

### Feel free to peruse at your leisure.
