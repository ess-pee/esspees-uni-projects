# Thing: a set of ESP32 firmware examples

(For more details of the development tools see [chapter two of the course
notes](https://iot.unphone.net/#sec:setup).)

To choose which example to run, edit `LABNUM` in `sketch/sketch.ino`.

Files:

- `sketch`:             source code
  - `sketch.ino`:       main entry points: `setup` and `loop`; this code acts
                        as the exercise runner
  - `Thing.h`:          shared declarations
  - `Ex01.cpp...Ex12.cpp`: the individual exercises
